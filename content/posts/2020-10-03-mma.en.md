## Is it a mistake to seek symbolic computation in a computer?

Most computer science students understand how computers perform numerical calculations.

For example, if you ask an `x86` computer to calculate `0xff+0xff00`, it can be written in assembly like this:

```asm
mov eax, 0xff   ;put the number 0xff into the eax register
add eax, 0xff00 ;add 0xff00 to the number in the eax register
```

As for decimals, they can be calculated with floating point numbers, which can be implemented in hardware. In fact, we have written a simple CPU and roughly know what these things look like in circuits.

However, many computer science students do not understand how computers perform symbolic calculations. For example, I want to calculate the following differential:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x
$$

How can a computer perform such operations? Please read "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" on your own, as it will not be elaborated here. Our focus today is on how to use Mathematica to calculate these things.

## The Path to a Usable Mathematica

If you want to use it for commercial or academic purposes, please use the licensed software, otherwise you will bear the consequences.
{{< /admonition>}}

Mathematica is commercial software, and the student version costs more than 400 yuan. You may not want to spend this money, after all, it's an American company, and there's nothing wrong with taking a little advantage. If you want to use it without spending money, there are mainly three ways:

- The official free version, which I use, namely wolframscript or wolframEngine
- Your school may have purchased Mathematica
- Cracked version, please refer to [here](https://tiebamma.github.io/InstallTutorial/)

What's the difference between wolframscript and Mathematica? The main difference is in the "user interface". Wolframscript is a REPL of an interpreter, and there is not much difference in the use of python and scheme. Mathematica, on the other hand, is a GUI software in the form of a "notebook", where each line of code is "a block" that can be executed separately.

At this point, readers should understand that wolframscript is for us programmers, and Mathematica is for non-programmers. Of course, it doesn't have to be so clear-cut, my suggestion is to experience both and then decide which one to use.

Here's a reminder, wolframscript may have mysterious download problems. If you're not working under Linux or don't have scientific internet access, whether you can install it or not depends purely on luck~

## Wolfram Language

### Wolfram Language Syntax

Mathematica is the frontend of Wolfram Language, and the code written in Mathematica is essentially Wolfram Language code.

In Wolfram Language, all operations seem to be accomplished through "functions". Its "function calling" syntax also seems very simple:

```mathematica
Func[arg1, arg2, ..., argn]
```

For example, addition can be calculated like this:

```mathematica
Plus[1, 2]
```

Multiplication can be calculated like this:

```mathematica
Times[1, 2]
```

![](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5f789285160a154a671c530c.jpg)

Readers may exclaim, isn't this the great scheme?

```scheme
(+ 1 2) ;-> 3
(* 1 2) ;-> 2
```

Unfortunately, this is not, or not entirely, the great scheme.

First of all, all Wolfram Language code will be parsed into "M-expressions", which can be verified with `FullForm`:

![3](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc788f3ffa7d37b380e9b1.png)

And this "M-expression" is a variant of "S-expression", simply put,

```scheme
(a b c d e f ...)
```

and

```mathematica
a[b, c, d, e, f, ...]
```

are equivalent.

But what's more interesting is the function of `Apply` in Wolfram Language, which is:

```mathematica
Apply[ a[b, c, d ...], a' ]
= a'[b, c, d ...]
```

For example:

![3](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc93043ffa7d37b39d8ecc.png)

Here, `{a, b, c}` is actually `List[a, b, c]`:

![4](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc93513ffa7d37b39e0f9b.png)

So, what's the difference between Wolfram Language and scheme? This starts with its evaluation rules.

### Evaluation rules of Wolfram Language

Before discussing the evaluation rules of Wolfram Language, it must be clear what "evaluation" refers to. Evaluation and reduction are similar but different concepts.

Reduction refers to, given a $\lambda$ term, we can use rules to change it into another $\lambda$ term, such as $(\lambda x. x a)(\lambda x . x)$ after $\beta$ reduction, will get $a$.

And evaluation refers to, continuously applying these reduction rules until reaching a fixed point. Generally, these "fixed points" are called "normal forms" or "canonical forms".

So, not rigorously speaking, reduction is a step of evaluation. Reduction is just a rewriting rule for transforming terms, while evaluation is a complete algorithm for rewriting terms into normal forms.

![5](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc95373ffa7d37b3a03cbb.png)

These three rules reveal an important fact:

- During evaluation, a "depth-first search" must be performed, that is, for the expression $(a b)$, the value of $a$, $val_{a}$, and the value of $b$, $val_{b}$, must be calculated first, and then the value of $(a b)$ is $(val_a val_b)$.

If the $\lambda$ term contains free variables, things will become more complicated. e.g.

$$
(\lambda x.xa)(\lambda x.x)
$$

In $\lambda$ calculus, performing $\beta$ reduction on this expression will get $a$. However, in the above evaluation rules, $a$ should be evaluated to $val_{a}$ first, and how this "free variable" $a$ is evaluated is undefined.

In fact, only closed terms (i.e., terms without free variables) can be evaluated. We generally use $\Lambda^{\circ}$ to represent the set of closed terms.

In scheme, evaluating a "free variable" will cause an error:

![6](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc97933ffa7d37b3a31b0a.png)

In Wolfram Language, the value of a "free variable" is itself:

![7](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc98453ffa7d37b3a3f4b8.png)

Not only is the value of a "free variable" itself, but any "M-expression that cannot be evaluated" also has a value of itself. More fundamentally, "not being able to be evaluated" is the norm for M-expressions, and "being able to be evaluated" is due to the predefinition of "reduction rules".

So how to define "reduction rules"? Wolfram Language provides `Set`. `Set` can be written as `=`, it defines that `a` in `Set[a, b]` should be reduced to `b`.

Obviously, we need some methods to express M expressions to define `a` in `Set[a, b]`, for example, we want to rewrite `factor[10]` as `10 * factor[9]`, but we don't want to define how to rewrite `factor[1.1]`. Wolfram Language calls these things Pattern, for example:

```mathematica
_
```

It can match all M-expressions, which can be checked with `MatchQ`:

![8](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc9be53ffa7d37b3a80444.png)

In this way, we understand why the "function definition" in Wolfram Language is like this:

```mathematica
factor[x_Integer] := x * factor[x - 1]
factor[0] := 1
```

Here `:=` means `SetDelayed`, it will prevent the "bound variable" from being evaluated immediately, if `Set` is used, it will cause some ridiculous problems:

![9](https://pic.downk.cc/item/5fdc9e653ffa7d37b3aad475.png)

### How to evaluate the design of Wolfram Language

The mathematical expressions we use often contain a lot of free variables. If all of them are bound, it will violate the preferences of mathematicians (whether it will become difficult to use is a question that can be further explored).

So Wolfram Language simply treats everything as a kind of "Primitive Value", and only reduces it when it needs to be reduced. In this way, "differential/integral with parameters", "pure expression simplification" have been simplified:
