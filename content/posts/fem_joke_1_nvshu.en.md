This article was originally published on Douban, and after its release, it stepped on many people's sensitive nerves and was reported and tragically shelved. This article does not contain any content that violates Chinese law or the Douban community convention, and I strongly disagree with Douban's censorship policy.

## N√ºshu

> N√ºshu (õÜÅõà¨), a mysterious female script, originated in Jiangyong County in southern Hunan Province. It is passed down from mother to daughter, from old to young, among Han and Yao women in Jiangyong County and its neighboring areas in Hunan Province. It is a unique and magical cultural phenomenon in human history. [^1]

N√ºshu was originally a professional content in archaeology and folklore, lying in the pile of old papers for many years. We don't know who first linked N√ºshu with feminism, but it has recently become a hot topic for feminists. "Women pass on to women", "Women help each other", "A kind of sunshine culture that gives women a voice, is a cultural resistance" [^2], the temptation of these discourses to feminists must be needless to say.

The "N√ºshu" understood under this discourse system naturally becomes the reserve of feminists. If anyone wants to invade this reserve

Here's a question, a type of "font" is generally corresponding to a language, so with so many languages in the world, what would happen if the "font" of a certain language is not on your computer? For example, "N√ºshu"?

## N√ºshu Font

If you are currently using the MacOS system, then this text may not display properly on your computer:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/6492831c1ddac507cc8bc2ae.png)

These two characters, "õÜÅõà¨", should appear as two squares or stacked lines. This is because you have not installed the "N√ºshu font", and the browser does not know how to map it to an image. However, interestingly, my ubuntu 22.04 can display it correctly by default:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/6492834f1ddac507cc8c1a7b.png)

This is because ubuntu has built-in a font called Noto Sans Nushu:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649283761ddac507cc8c5639.png)

The author of this font is Lisa Huang, a French-Chinese designer, [ayaka](https://linktr.ee/ayaka14732) copied it to the Noto repository, pay attention to the *nushu-script* organization in the picture below, it will be tested later.

## New N√ºshu Font

Two years ago, a student named "Mian Yun Yi Li" [^3] (hereinafter referred to as "Mian Yi"), began to create his own N√ºshu font based on the Willow Leaf N√ºshu script. On International Women's Day this year, he released a new version and promoted it on Bilibili. The "õÜÅõà¨" I showed on MacOS earlier was displayed after installing his font.

In addition to being a N√ºshu font creator, this creator's other identity has stepped heavily on the sensitive nerves of feminists--an anime artist with a hint of erotic elements.

After seeing the video he posted, some feminists couldn't sit still.

{{<  admonition "note" >}}
The "x-ization" here refers to "sexualization".
{{< /admonition >}}

From beginning to end, what Mianyi did was to create a new set of N√ºshu fonts. The so-called "sexualization" accusation is simply because he applied some N√ºshu characters to his painting creations. Feminists say that he "sexualizes N√ºshu", and the comments on this Weibo post, collectively demonstrate the shameless mentality of feminists who regard N√ºshu as their private property.

## Joke

If it's just the story mentioned above, it's just a not-so-rare "feminist ugliness". What does "joke" mean?

There are several feminist groups on Douban, one of the larger ones is the so-called "[Normcore Return to the Basics](https://www.douban.com/group/729670/)" group. This group reposted the Weibo post of "Whose Misogyny bot" on March 16 and posted a new [thread](https://www.douban.com/group/topic/285029285/?_i=9022986VwvQ-Is,7323973VwvQ-Is)[^4]. After seeing it, I couldn't help but make a sarcastic comment:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649285ac1ddac507cc8f95e4.png)

Let's not talk about the bottomless personal attacks on me by feminists (this is the norm), I felt very strange after seeing their replies, what does "there are already people doing it" mean? It turns out that there was a comment above:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649285d21ddac507cc8fc486.png)

His sentence means to separate Mianyi from the N√ºshu community. Mianyi is a bad person, a "v person", a thief of N√ºshu culture, while the "professional volunteer team" is a good person, a inheritor of N√ºshu culture. However, he seems to have overlooked a question:

**Is there really no relationship between Mianyi and the "professional volunteer team"?**

Let's go back to Github. The domain name nushuscript.org belongs to the nushu-script organization, and who are the members of this organization?

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649285fe1ddac507cc90043f.png)

Wow, this anime avatar, this nickname, isn't it familiar? It turns out that this Hunan momo, uid 152513074 Douban user, the "professional volunteer team" in his mouth, refers to the team where Mianyi is.

So, let's take a look at who has been the most active in this organization recently?

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/6492862e1ddac507cc9040ea.png)

These 10 repos, the most active and highest Star recently is Mianyi's Nyushu font~

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649286441ddac507cc905d9a.png)

All the discussions last month, only Mianyi was posting~ (Poor Mianyi, no one paid attention to him)

This is really too funny. Feminists originally wanted to use a "professional volunteer team" to dissolve Mianyi's contribution to the Nushu community, but Mianyi is a member of this volunteer team. This also reflects the characteristic of feminists' "bluffing": they talk nonsense without clarifying themselves, not using facts and reasoning to convince readers, but using the emotions of words to kidnap readers.

## Who does Nushu belong to?

Who does Nushu belong to? Feminists believe that the font created by women belongs to them. I think this mentality is very rogue, at least, it definitely does not belong to those who have not even installed the Nushu font:

![](https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/649286761ddac507cc909c27.png)

{{<  admonition "note" >}}
This is a picture from the Weibo contributor, you can clearly see that the contributor has not installed the Nushu font
{{< /admonition >}}

Nushu as a culture belongs to those who truly research it, understand it, build it, and inherit it. Mianyi's understanding of Nushu is obviously much higher than those "generally through feminists" on Douban. In this sense, he is more qualified to claim ownership of Nushu than feminists. But he didn't, instead, he looks forward to more people joining the Nushu community, so that this wealth passed down by the ancestors can be used by more people.

"A gentleman is open and relaxed, a villain is always worried", who is the "gentleman" and who is the "villain"?
